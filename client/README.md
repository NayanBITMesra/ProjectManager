# Client Application

This is a React application named "client". It serves as a project manager interface, allowing users to manage projects and clients effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate a `build` directory containing the optimized application.

## Running Tests

```
npm test
```
